# konsulta 

"Konsulta" is a consultation registration application made for the purposes of learning Java, Spring Boot and databases. The documentation was prepared for the International Baccalaureate Computer Science internal assessment. This project was the first full-stack application done by me.

The documentation for this project can be seen <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OSi-oeuNtgirjJQLitgWVh73BSLmwOgj/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>.

There is also a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uJw7W1oXRYUFBVwLW2N3t--FiyU4BbvV/view?usp=sharing">video</a> which guides through the application's usage.
